Read  the  following  passage  and  mark  the  letter  A,  B,  C,  or  D  on  your answer  sheet  to  indicate  the 
correct answer to each of the questions. 
In our busy, stress-filled modern times, how do people meet their life partner In Britain, over 50% 
of single adults think that online dating provides the answer. Internet dating sites have become the most 
popular way to meet people. But is the Internet the ideal way to find their true love? The dating agencies 
think so. They are using science in an attempt to match people more closely with suitable partners. In the 
past, dating agencies just used a simple personality profile, and a hobbies and interests questionnaire to 
put people together. Now, however, more and more of them are using psychometric tests. These detailed 
psychological  questionnaires  were  developed  by  scientists  at  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century  to 
recruit good spies for the First World War. Later they were used in business to find the right people for 
the right jobs. And now online dating agencies are using the same techniques. If you logged on to a dating 
agency today, you might have to answer over 200 questions about yourself and the kind of person you 
would like to meet. It would take a very long time. 
But does it work? Yes, says Dr Tan Fellowes, a senior research scientist at one of the most popular 
agencies. It allows us to match people far more closely with compatible partners, so that there is a greater 
chance of success. So how does it work in real life? Here are two people's stories. Cathy is an attractive 
fitness instructor. "I was working long hours and wasn't meeting man that I was interested in, so I joined 
a dating agency," says Cathy. "I was matched with several men and one of them was David. When I first 
met him I wasn't impressed. But as we started talking, I discovered that we had a huge amount in common. 
I liked his 
attitude to life and the way he talked, and I realized that I really liked him. So, as a fitness instructor, I 
told him he had to get in shape!" Seven months later, Cathy and David got married. "And now I think he 
is the most gorgeous man in the world!" she says. Simon's experience was different. "I wanted a serious 
relationship and a friend suggested online dating. I had some very pleasant dates with some nice women 
and had a good time. All of them shared my interested film and travel, some were compatible, but there 
just wasn't that sparked of attraction. It was strange." 
Dr Sarah Kenton agrees. She is the author of How to meet your Soulmate. She says, "Psychometric 
od  testing  is  useful,  but  can't  take account  of  attraction  for  someone because they  have  something  you 
haven't  got."  As  the  old  saying  goes,  "Opposites  attract."  So,  perhaps  science can  help  you  find  your 
perfect partner, but sometimes it's just down to chemistry.

The use of  Chatbot  A.I  in  language teaching  has  revolutionized the  way we  approach  language 
learning. These intelligent software programs offer a range of benefits that make language education more 
engaging, effective, and accessible. 
One of the most significant benefits of Chatbot A.I in language teaching is the personalization it 
offers. Chatbots  are  capable  of  adapting  to  each  student's  learning  style,  pace,  and  ability,  delivering 
lessons that are tailored specifically to their needs. This ensures that students receive instruction that is 
most relevant to them, leading to improved engagement and motivation. 
Another advantage of Chatbot A.I is that it provides students with immediate feedback. Unlike a 
traditional classroom setting where students have to wait for a teacher to correct their mistakes, Chatbots 
can provide instant feedback on pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary, helping them to identify and 
address their weaknesses in real-time. 
The  availability  of  Chatbot  A.I  technology  24/7  also  makes  language  learning  more  accessible. 
Students  can  practice their  language  skills  at  any  time,  from  anywhere,  without  having  to  worry  about 
scheduling  conflicts  with  a  teacher.  This  flexibility  means  that  language  learning  can  become  a  more 
integral part of students' daily lives, helping to embed the new language more deeply in their minds. 
Finally, Chatbot A.I provides an enjoyable and engaging experience for language learners. With 
its use of gamification techniques and interactive dialogues, Chatbots make language learning feel like a 
fun and engaging activity, rather than a chore.
